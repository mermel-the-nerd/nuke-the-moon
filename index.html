        <h2>It wasn't just our idea: Project A119</h2>
        <p>
            Project A119 was a top-secret U.S. Air Force plan in the late 1950s to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon. The goal was to demonstrate American military and technological superiority during the Cold War, especially in response to the Soviet Union’s advancements in space exploration. The explosion would have been visible from Earth, showcasing U.S. capabilities. 
            Although the plan was ultimately abandoned, it was deemed to be technically feasible.

            <br>
           <br>Who approved this? I'm trying to sleep, and this giant flashlight in the sky keeps shining through my window. Not impressed. Absolutely the worst nightlight ever.</p>

        <p><em>"Overrated and inconsistent"</em>
            <br>
            <br>The moon? Totally overrated. Sometimes it’s full, sometimes it’s barely there—make up your mind! It’s like trying to plan a night out with a flakey friend. Sure, it lights up the sky a bit, but for something that’s been around this long, I expected more. Also, no mention of how it messes with the tides and ruins my beach day plans. Gave it one star because it looks kinda cool during an eclipse, but that’s about it.</p>

        <p><em>"Too far away!"</em>
            <br>
           <br> I tried to walk there, but it took way too long. No sidewalks, no rest stops, and honestly, it’s just floating up there doing nothing. A total scam! Why does everyone love it so much? Zero stars. Would not recommend.</p>
